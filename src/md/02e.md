## Our page sucks!

Granted, I told you to make it just JSON data in divs but that's on you for listening.

### Let's make ourselves some components!

Recall (if I already mentioned it) that general convention in Svelte/kit is to keep components colocated with their pages (in the corresponding `route` directory) unless they're used in multiple places across the project. In our case this also happens to be more convenient, so I will be doing that (but feel free to go your own way.)

Co-located with our recently made `+page.svelte` you'll find a `components` folder with an alread-existing `ConstructorTable.svelte` file. Let's make one in the same fashion for Drivers. Feel free to call it whatever you want, but I used `DriverTable.svelte`.

Here's some HTML to get you started:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import type { Driver, Team } from '$lib/server/db/types';

	export let drivers: Driver[];

	const teams: { [key: string]: Team } = {};
</script>

<table>
	<h2>Drivers:</h2>
	<tr>
		<th> Position </th>
		<th> Driver </th>
		<th> Code </th>
		<th> Team </th>
		<th> Points Total </th>
	</tr>
	<!-- for each driver...template these fields -->
	<tr class="driver">
		<td> position </td>
		<td> name </td>
		<td> code </td>
		<!-- looks like we may want to use context for this one... -->
		<td> teamName </td>
		<td> points </td>
	</tr>
</table>

<style>
	.driver {
		background-color: lightgray;
		padding: 10px;
		border: 1px solid black;
		color: black;
	}

	.driver:hover {
		background-color: darkgray;
	}

	td {
		min-width: 50px;
		text-align: center;
	}
</style>
```

Now is a good time to start testing this our using Sveltekit's live hot-reloading...so here's some better HTML for your `+page.svelte` to load the component into:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import type { Driver } from '$lib/server/db/types';
	import type { PageData } from './$types';

	export let data: PageData;

	/*
    This is unnecessary, but you do get to use a reactive assignment later on
    If you don't want to use this, you also don't need the reactive assignment below!
   */
	function preprocess(drivers: Driver[]) {
		return drivers.map((driver) => {
			const names = driver.name.split(' ');
			return {
				...driver,
				name: `${names[1].toLocaleUpperCase()} ${names[0]}`
			};
		});
	}

	// Every time data.drivers changes (which tbf it won't) this will rerun the name formatter
	$: drivers = preprocess(data.drivers);

	// it does seem like our DriverTable expects something to be in the context though...
</script>

<div class="page-wrapper">
	<div class="current">
		<h2>Current Standings</h2>
		<div class="current-table">
			<!-- Add a DriverTable -->
			<!-- Add a ConstructorTable -->
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<style>
	h2 {
		grid-column: 1 / -1;
	}

	.page-wrapper {
		padding: 20px;
		width: 100%;
		/* ABF - always be flexing */
		display: flex;
		justify-content: center;
	}

	.current > h2 {
		text-align: center;
	}

	.current {
		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
		padding: 10px;
		width: 80vw;
	}

	.current-table {
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
		grid-gap: 20px;
	}
</style>
```

### Component Context

Once the components are added, we see a bit of an issue with the Driver table...it's expecting some data! That could be passed in via context, so what the heck...let's do it!

Here's the [Svelte official documentation](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) for the Context API. We'll need to set it on the `+page.svelte` file and read it in the `DriverTable.svelte` component.

To transform our incoming `Team` data to a map of `{id: Team}` to put into the context, this snippet may be handy...but you didn't get it from me.

```typescript
// if you named your loaded data field something else, then be sure to update it!
data.teams.reduce((acc, team) => ({ ...acc, [team.id]: team }), {});
```

### Stuff should be happening now!

Let's go ahead and level up our data!

Head back to `app.d.ts`...and add a database onto your `locals` like so:

```typescript
interface Locals {
	// ...
	db: SqliteDB;
}
```

Notice that it is initially not instantiated...that is by design in our case. When handling auth in Sveltekit, one convention is to _not_ provide 'sensitive' data unless the user proves authorization.

!! I will also note that you _cannot_ guarantee route protection/data security by using layouts or layout loads...page, server, and layout functions all run in parallel, and it's easy to get out of sync.

Anyways, let's head back to our `hooks.server.ts` and now whenever we see an authenticated user (whatever field you may have used) we will populate the new locals field like so:

```typescript
// this way, even if someone made it to a page they shouldn't have, they can't do anything with it
if (userIsAuthenticaterated) {
	// your locals field = new SqliteDB();
}
```

and now in the server load function, we can update our data load to something like:

```typescript
return {
	drivers: locals.db.getAllDrivers(),
	races: locals.db.getAllRaces(),
	teams: locals.db.getAllTeams()
};
```

and our data should be extra juicy.

### ONE LAST THING

Recall that advanced routing in Sveltekit allows for path parameters using the `[name]` folder convention under `routes`. If you click into the driver or constructors folders within our current working directory, you'll see this pattern.  

Let's update the server loading functions for `drivers` to pull in the data via our new locals object. If you want to see what all methods are provided by the DB, you can search your project for 'DATABASEBABY' (or look under `src/lib/server/db`).

Here's the reference again to the [Svelte documentation on routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing).

And now whenever we click a driver row in the table we should get their driver page! Nice!

### Let's go to the next lesson!
