### Things I didn't cover:

- Special elements (<svelte:... />)
- Forms (and SuperForm)
- Advanced Svelte Stores ($nav, $page, etc)

### Are there any in-depth learning resources you can recommend?

- I learned Svelte/kit through [LevelUpTuts](https://levelup.video/) - and I _think_ this may be free now?
- There is a course on building [Modern SaaS Apps](https://courses.huntabyte.com/modern-saas) that I can recommend if you want to dive deeper into using Sveltekit for ecommerce.
- YouTube! [Huntabyte's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQy-AYhZIlE&list=PLq30BP0TIcqXP149TyFMfRhnMT6T5--e5) is very helpful and is the source of a lot of my knowledge.
