## Sveltekit

This workshop is using the first-party metaframework for Svelte - Sveltekit. Sveltekit has excellent documentation and an online REPL that I will link to at times. You will also see me embedding various Svelte components as we move along.

### Some Svelte Conventions

- There _can be_ but there isn't typically (and doesn't really need to be) a global CSS file. Instead you will use the `:global(<selector>){}` syntax in layout files.

#### Anatomy of a Svelte file

```svelte
<!-- $lib/components/BudgetIdon.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
	export let src: string;
	export let alt: string = '';
</script>

<img {src} {alt} />

<style>
	img {
		height: 15px;
	}
</style>
```

Svelte files will always end in `.svelte` and start with the `script` tag, followed by the `html` content, followed by the `style` css. Each of these sections is optional, including the HTML.

The `export` keyword in the script indicates exported values - typically these are the component props, although not always.

Looking at the HTML content here also notes a bit of Svelte syntactic sugar:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	function click(e) {
		console.log(e);
	}
</script>

<img {src} {alt} on:click />
```

Similar to other frameworks, if your variables or functions have the same names as the props, you can simply shorthand them like `{this}`. This works _sort of similarly_ Svelte directives sometimes, depending on the type. The Svelte plugin for `VS Code` will update this automatically if you set it to `Format on Save` so I won't spend too much time here.

On that note, Svelte components handle all the typical HTML events via the `on:<event>={callback}` prop:

```svelte
<!-- TextInput.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
	export let placeholder: string;
	export let chngFn: (e: Event) => void;
</script>

<input type="text" {placeholder} on:change={chngFn} />
```

Svelte also supports _two-way data binding_ which has a similar shorthand as above when variable names match:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let placeholder: string;
	export let value: string;
</script>

<input type="text" {placeholder} bind:value />
```

If you really want to get crazy with _two-way data binding_, because who wouldn't, you can pass data up or down as far as you want:

<BoundVariables />

### Styles

CSS in Svelte (and Sveltekit) is scoped to the module by default, unless overriden with the `:global(<selector>)` keyword.
