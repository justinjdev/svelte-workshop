## Props

In Svelte, passing data to child components is straightforward and intuitive, utilizing a common mechanism known as "props" (properties). Props are how data flows down from parent components to child components, allowing for a modular and maintainable code structure. If the parent component does not pass a prop, and the prop has a default value in the child component, the default value is used. Props can be any type supported by TypeScript, including functions.

In Svelte, any variable that is exported in a child component can be used as a prop. This means that when you instantiate a child component in a parent component, you can pass data to these exported variables. These variables correspond to arrtibutes of the same name on the child component.

```svelte
<script>
	export let message = 'Default message'; // `message` is a prop
</script>

<p>{message}</p>
```

Also of note, props will be updated reactively when the parent state changes by default.

## Data binding...again

Two-way data binding in Svelte is a powerful feature that automatically synchronizes the state between the UI and the application's state. This means that changes in the UI input will immediately update the corresponding data in the application's state, and vice versa, any changes to the application's data will be reflected in the UI. Svelte achieves this using the `bind:` directive.

```svelte
<script>
	let name = ''; // State variable
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={name} placeholder="Enter your name" />
<!-- `value` of the input is bound to the `name` variable -->
<p>Hello, {name}!</p>
<!-- Any changes in the input will automatically update here and vice versa -->
```

<svelte:component this={TwoWayBinding} />

### Common Use Cases for Two-Way Binding

- Forms: Two-way data binding is especially useful in forms where you need to gather inputs from users and submit them. It simplifies the process of collecting and validating user input.

- UI Controls: For dynamic UI controls like sliders or switch toggles, two-way data binding helps in keeping the UI state and the data model in sync effortlessly.

Although two-way data binding is convenient, it's important to ensure that inputs do not become uncontrollable. It's often good practice to validate or process data before updating the state. For large applications with complex data structures or a large number of bindings, consider the implications of too much reactivity, as every change triggers updates. In such cases, it might be beneficial to manage updates more granularly.
