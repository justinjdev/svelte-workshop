## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern, compiled TypeScript framework that focuses on shifting operations to compile time, resulting in highly efficient and lightweight code. It offers a reactive approach to building user interfaces, where changes to the data automatically update the DOM. With its simplicity and performance focus, Svelte enables developers to create fast, elegant web applications with minimal boilerplate code.

## Anatomy of a Svelte file

Svelte files will always end in `.svelte` and start with the `script` tag, followed by the `html` content, followed by the `style` css. Each of these sections is optional, including the HTML.

### HTML

In Svelte, the HTML is written almost as you would in a regular HTML file, but with enhanced capabilities due to Svelte's templating syntax. This includes:

    - Directives: These are special attributes prefixed by let, on, bind, class, and more, that allow for dynamic behaviors directly within the HTML.
    - Blocks: Svelte provides special syntax for reactive updates, conditionals, loops, and more, such as `{#if}`, `{#each}`, and `{#await}`.
    - Interpolation: Curly braces `{}` are used to embed TypeScript expressions within the HTML, which are reactively updated whenever the underlying data changes.

### TypeScript

The `<script>` tag in a Svelte component is where you define the component's reactive state, computed properties, functions, module context, and more. Svelte enhances standard TypeScript with a few additional features:

    - Reactive Declarations: Variables can be made reactive by prefixing - expressions with $:. Svelte will automatically update the DOM when these reactive variables change.
    - Component Logic: Functions and event handlers are defined here, managing everything from component initialization to handling user interactions.
    - Props and Context: Components can accept props from parents, and context can be used to pass data deeply.

### CSS

CSS in a Svelte component is scoped by default, meaning styles defined in a component only apply to that component. This is achieved without the use of shadow DOM but rather by appending unique identifiers to CSS selectors at build time. This prevents styles from leaking out and affecting other parts of the application unintentionally.

#### Example of a Svelte Component Integration

Here’s a simple example to illustrate how HTML, CSS, and TypeScript are integrated within a single Svelte component:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let name = 'World';
	function greet() {
		alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
	}
</script>

<p>Hello, {name}!</p>
<button on:click={greet}> Greet </button>

<style>
	button {
		background-color: blue;
		color: white;
		padding: 8px 15px;
		border: none;
		border-radius: 5px;
	}
</style>
```

<Hello />

In this example, the TypeScript defines a reactive variable and a function, the CSS scopes styles to the button within this component, and the HTML uses Svelte’s templating syntax to bind the greet function to the button’s click event and dynamically display the name.

This integration allows developers to manage a component's logic, styling, and structure in a cohesive and encapsulated manner, promoting maintainability and reusability in web development projects.
