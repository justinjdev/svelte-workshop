<script context="module">

    import StyledDiv from '$lib/components/examples/StyledDiv.svelte';
    export { BoundVariables, StyledDiv };
</script>

### What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern, compiled JavaScript framework that focuses on shifting operations to compile time, resulting in highly efficient and lightweight code. It offers a reactive approach to building user interfaces, where changes to the data automatically update the DOM. With its simplicity and performance focus, Svelte enables developers to create fast, elegant web applications with minimal boilerplate code.

#### Anatomy of a Svelte file

```svelte
<!-- $lib/components/BudgetIdon.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
	export let src: string;
	export let alt: string = '';
</script>

<img {src} {alt} />

<style>
	img {
		height: 15px;
	}
</style>
```

Svelte files will always end in `.svelte` and start with the `script` tag, followed by the `html` content, followed by the `style` css. Each of these sections is optional, including the HTML.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	function click(e) {
		console.log(e);
	}
</script>

<img {src} {alt} on:click />
```

Similar to other frameworks, if your variables or functions have the same names as the props, you can simply shorthand them like `{this}`. This works _sort of similarly_ Svelte directives sometimes, depending on the type. The Svelte plugin for `VS Code` will update this automatically if you set it to `Format on Save` so I won't spend too much time here.

On that note, Svelte components handle all the typical HTML events via the `on:<event>={callback}` prop:

```svelte
<!-- TextInput.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
	export let placeholder: string;
	export let chngFn: (e: Event) => void;
</script>

<input type="text" {placeholder} on:change={chngFn} />
```

Svelte also supports _two-way data binding_ which has a similar shorthand as above when variable names match:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let placeholder: string;
	export let value: string;
</script>

<input type="text" {placeholder} bind:value />
```

If you really want to get crazy with _two-way data binding_, because who wouldn't, you can pass data up or down as far as you want:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import TextInput from '$lib/components/examples/TextArea.svelte';
	import Division from '../Division.svelte';

	let value = 'Adrian Newey set to leave Red Bull Racing at the start of 2025.';
</script>

<Division />

<h4>These text areas are bound together, unlike Adrian Newey and Red Bull Racing!</h4>

<TextInput placeholder="This is useless" bind:value />

<TextInput placeholder="This is also useless" bind:value />

<Division />
```

<BoundVariables />

Svelte also provides logic blocks that you can use within your HTML markup, it is probably simplest to link to them [here](https://svelte.dev/docs/logic-blocks) and specifically note the `if` and `each` blocks:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    const colors = ['papaya', 'racing green'];
</script>

{#if someBool}
    <span>it's true!</span>
{/if}

{#each color of colors}
    <span>{color}</span>
{/each}
```

### Styles

CSS in Svelte (and Sveltekit) is scoped to the module by default, unless overriden with the `:global(<selector>)` keyword. Injecting CSS variables into the scope is done via the `style` prop on a given HTML element:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	const colors = [
		{ value: 'red', text: 'Red' },
		{ value: 'green', text: 'Green' },
		{ value: 'blue', text: 'Blue' }
	];

	let selectedColor = 'white';

	$: console.log(selectedColor);
</script>

<select name="colors" id="colors" on:change={(event) => (selectedColor = event.target.value)}>
	{#each colors as color}
		<option value={color.value}>{color.text}</option>
	{/each}
</select>

<div class="colored" style="--color:{selectedColor}"></div>

<style>
	.colored {
		width: 200px;
		height: 200px;
		border: 1px solid #ccc;
		border-radius: 5px;
		background-color: var(--color);
	}
</style>
```

<StyledDiv />

### Project Structure

Sveltekit follows what is likely a common pattern if you've worked within meta frameworks before:

```text
my-project/
├ src/
│ ├ lib/
│ │ ├ server/
│ │ │ └ [your server-only lib files]
│ │ └ [your lib files]
│ ├ params/
│ │ └ [your param matchers]
│ ├ routes/
│ │ └ [your routes]
│ ├ app.html
│ ├ error.html
│ ├ hooks.client.js
│ ├ hooks.server.js
│ └ service-worker.js
├ static/
│ └ [your static assets]
│ └ example.png
├ tests/
│ └ [your tests]
├ package.json
├ svelte.config.js
├ tsconfig.json
└ vite.config.js
```

Generally, Svelte convention is that when components are only used within a given component or page, they are co-located with that component/page. When components are used across multiple components or pages, it's a good idea to consider using the `$lib` folder and organizing within there as you see fit. Files can then be imported like so:

```svelte
import StyledDiv from '$lib/components/examples/StyledDiv.svelte';
```

`$lib` is a _default_ custom alias that will resolve to `/src/lib/`. I will point out that Sveltekit does allow you to customize and add more aliases, but we won't touch on that here.

#### Routing

##### Server-only Files

#### Static Files

Public files can be placed under `/static/` and organized however you see fit. Following the directory structure above, these may be accessed via absolute imports anywhere within the codebase like so (note that I _exclude_ the name `static`): `/example.png`. Relative imports _will_ work in many cases (`./example.png` depending what level you are at), however are unnecessary and easily break.

#### Build Files

Build files are generated to `.sveltekit/`, can be ignored, and don't need not be committed to Git!

### Further Reading

I've covered everything here that I _think_ you need to know to proceed, however [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure) is the full Sveltekit documentation on project structure.
