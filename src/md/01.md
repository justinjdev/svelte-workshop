## Sveltekit

This project is using the first-party metaframework for Svelte - Sveltekit. Sveltekit has excellent documentation and an online REPL that I will link to at times. I'll indicate these links with the ![sveltekit.png](/assets/sveltekit.png) icon.

### Weird things about Sveltekit:

- Your first visit to a website built with Sveltekkit will always be SSR.

### Some Svelte Conventions

- There _can be_ but there isn't typically (and doesn't really need to be) a global CSS file. Instead you will use the `:global(<selector>){}` syntax in layout files.
