## Let's create a page and load some data!

Feel free to reference the Svelte [examples](https://svelte.dev/examples/hello-world) as needed!

Navigate to `./src/routes/exercise/f1` and check out the page that's there now. Recall that `+page.svelte` in a directory under `routes/` means a page exists at the path.

We want to pull in some data with a _server-side load_. The data we're looking for is in `./src/routes/exercise/f1/data.ts` (or you can search for FINDTHEDATA :)) and we want to pull in all of the exported fields (drivers, races, results, teams) and return those on the load object.

Here's the [Svelte documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) for loading for reference - if you search for `+page.server.js` you'll find what you need, albeit with JSDoc and _not_ in Typescript.

Once we've gotten the data loaded, let's just drop it into a `<div>` on our page to make sure it's working:

```html
<div>{JSON.stringify(theData)}</div>
<div>{JSON.stringify(thatData)}</div>
...
```

### And now let's check out the [page](/exercise/f1).

If it all works then you are the best developer actually alive. If it didn't then you are still the best developer alive, and I wrote terrible instructions.

### Let's go to the next lesson!
