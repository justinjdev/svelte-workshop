## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern, compiled JavaScript framework that focuses on shifting operations to compile time, resulting in highly efficient and lightweight code. It offers a reactive approach to building user interfaces, where changes to the data automatically update the DOM. With its simplicity and performance focus, Svelte enables developers to create fast, elegant web applications with minimal boilerplate code.

### Why should I learn Svelte?

It is always good to have multiple tools in your toolbox! If you're thinking _what about React?_ then I discuss that a little bit [here](/learn/sveltevsreact).

### What if I have never done frontend?

Then you're my target audience! I believe creating applications with Sveltekit is the most straightforward way for someone to break into frontend development. Hopefully this class helps prove that!

### Are there any learning resources you can recommend?

- I learned Svelte/kit through [LevelUpTuts](https://levelup.video/) - and I _think_ this may be free now?
- There is a course on building [Modern SaaS Apps](https://courses.huntabyte.com/modern-saas) that I can recommend if you want to dive deeper into using Sveltekit for ecommerce.
- YouTube! [Huntabyte's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQy-AYhZIlE&list=PLq30BP0TIcqXP149TyFMfRhnMT6T5--e5) is very helpful and is the source of a lot of my knowledge.
