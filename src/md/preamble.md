# I am not suggesting we throw out React!

I want to be very clear - React is considered best practice for building frontends at ZipRecruiter. Neither I nor the people who approved this workshop are suggesting that we discontinue use of React or prepare for a migration to Svelte (or any other frontend framework) over React. Please expect to continue to use React in the course of your work here at ZipRecruiter.

### Then why should I learn Svelte?

It is always good to have multiple tools in your toolbox! If you're thinking _what about React?_ then I discuss that a little bit [here](/learn/sveltevsreact).

### About this workshop

This workshop is using the first-party meta-framework for Svelte - Sveltekit. If you are familiar with NextJS (for React) then many concepts will translate here in some shape. Sveltekit has excellent documentation and an online REPL that I will link to at times. Links to official Svelte documentation will appear like this with the Svelte icon: [Svelte.dev](https://www.svelte.dev).

Some deliberate decisions to note:

- Most of the content in this workshop is written in markdown and rendered to HTML via MDsveX. Don't expect incredibly idiomatic HTML most of the time from the lesson writeups.
- Data is coming from a sqlite database that is included with the project.
- I'll cover the pieces of Sveltekit that I am able to, but ~75 minutes is not a lot of time to hit every juicy tidbit.

### What should I expect to learn?

I will present the highlights of Svelte and include some example exercises to complete as we make our way to a simple, functioning Svelte UI. When we are done, my main goal is for you to leave the workshop with a solid understanding of how Svelte works and whether or not you are interested in learning more.

### What if I'm not a frontend wizard?

Neither am I :) However hopefully you understand basic HTML, Typescript, and CSS - this is certainly not a "first concepts" approach to learning a frontend framework. I believe creating applications with Sveltekit is the most straightforward way for someone to break into frontend development. As a _classically trained backend developer_, I found it was a great way to break into frontend concepts and avoid a lot of the pitfalls of other frameworks. Simple put, the way Svelte (and Sveltekit) works makes sense to my brain, and I am able to iterate very quickly with these concepts.
