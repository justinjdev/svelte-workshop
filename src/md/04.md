## Lifecycles

In Svelte, lifecycle functions allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life, such as when it mounts to the DOM, updates, or before it is destroyed. These functions are crucial for managing resources, subscriptions, and other side effects in a component-based architecture. Svelte provides several lifecycle functions, which can be imported from the Svelte package.

### 1. `onMount`

`onMount` is used to run code after the component is first rendered and added to the DOM. This is the right place to fetch data, add event listeners, or perform any setup that requires a DOM node.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	let data: any[] = [];

	onMount(async (): Promise<void> => {
		const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
		data = await response.json();
	});
</script>

<ul>
	{#each data as item (item.id)}
		<li>{item.name}</li>
	{/each}
</ul>
```

In this example, `onMount` is used to fetch data from an API after the component is rendered, and then the data is displayed in a list.

### 2. `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate`

`beforeUpdate` runs before the DOM is updated in response to state changes. `afterUpdate` runs after the DOM updates. These functions are useful for performing actions based on state changes before or after the DOM reflects these changes.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { beforeUpdate, afterUpdate } from 'svelte';
	let count = 0;

	beforeUpdate((): void => {
		console.log('The update is about to happen.');
	});

	afterUpdate((): void => {
		console.log('The update has completed.');
	});
</script>

<button on:click={() => (count += 1)}>
	Count: {count}
</button>
```

This component logs a message before and after it updates, which can help in debugging or when you need to perform actions around render updates.

### 3. `onDestroy`

`onDestroy` is called right before a component is removed from the DOM. This is where you should clean up any resources such as timers, subscriptions, or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { onDestroy } from 'svelte';

	let time = new Date();

	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		time = new Date();
	}, 1000);

	onDestroy((): void => {
		clearInterval(interval);
	});
</script>

<p>The current time is: {time.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
```

In this example, an interval updates the current time every second. `onDestroy` ensures the interval is cleared when the component is destroyed, preventing the interval from continuing to run and potentially causing performance issues or bugs.

## Transitions and Animations

Svelte includes built-in directives to handle animations and transitions, making it easy to add motion to elements as they enter or leave the DOM, or even when their properties change.

### 1. Transitions

Transitions in Svelte are applied using the `transition:` directive. Svelte provides several built-in transition functions, such as `fade`, `slide`, `fly`, `scale`, and more. You can customize these transitions with various parameters to control duration, delay, easing, and other properties.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { fade, slide } from 'svelte/transition';
	let visible: boolean = true;
</script>

<button on:click={() => (visible = !visible)}> Toggle </button>

{#if visible}
	<div transition:slide|local={{ duration: 300 }}>
		<p transition:fade={{ delay: 100, duration: 300 }}>Hello, world!</p>
	</div>
{/if}
```

In this example, when the `div` and its child `p` element are inserted or removed from the DOM, they animate using the `slide` and `fade` transitions, respectively. The `slide` transition affects the `div`, and the `fade` transition affects the `p`. The `|local` modifier ensures that the transition only plays when this specific block is created or destroyed, not when other conditional content changes.

### 2. Animations

Svelte also supports more continuous animations using the `animate:` directive. This can be used to smoothly animate changes to element positions when the list of items is reordered.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { flip } from 'svelte/animate';
	let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

	function shuffleItems() {
		items = items.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
	}
</script>

<button on:click={shuffleItems}>Shuffle</button>

<ul>
	{#each items as item (item)}
		<li animate:flip>{{ item }}</li>
	{/each}
</ul>
```

Here, `flip` animation is used to smoothly transition elements to their new positions when the list is shuffled. The `flip` stands for "First, Last, Invert, Play" and is an algorithm to determine how elements have moved in the DOM.

### 3. Custom CSS Transitions and Animations

Besides the built-in directives, you can also use CSS for more custom transitions and animations. This is useful when the built-in transitions do not meet your specific needs or when you want to create complex animations.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let rotate: boolean = false;
</script>

<div class="box" class:rotated={rotate} on:click={() => (rotate = !rotate)}></div>

<style>
	.box {
		width: 100px;
		height: 100px;
		background-color: blue;
		transition: transform 0.5s ease;
	}
	.rotated {
		transform: rotate(90deg);
	}
</style>
```

In this example, clicking on the box toggles the `rotated` class, which applies a CSS transition to rotate the box.
