(For the record if we got this far, I didn't expect it to happen.)

## So Wordle kind of works now.

But the on-screen keyboard _doesn't_ seem to work. Let's fix that!

The app is currently setup to propogate keypresses with a custom event, maybe we should duplicate that event to be fired from the on-screen keyboard? Let's handle that.

[Here's](https://svelte.dev/docs/element-directives) a handy link to the official docs for Svelte's `on` directive and [here's](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/component-events) their tutorial page on creating events.

We want to dispatch the event from the `Key` component whenever the `div` element is clicked. We want to propogate the event through the `Keyboard` component, and then handle it in the `GameContainer`.

Once that's set up, we should be good to go!

### Let's go to the last lesson!
