## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern, compiled JavaScript framework that focuses on shifting operations to compile time, resulting in highly efficient and lightweight code. It offers a reactive approach to building user interfaces, where changes to the data automatically update the DOM. With its simplicity and performance focus, Svelte enables developers to create fast, elegant web applications with minimal boilerplate code.

### Why should I learn Svelte?

It is always good to have multiple tools in your toolbox! If you're thinking _what about React?_ then I discuss that a little bit [here](/learn/sveltevsreact).

### What if I have never done frontend?

Then you're my target audience! I believe creating applications with Sveltekit is the most straightforward way for someone to break into frontend development. Hopefully this class helps prove that case!
