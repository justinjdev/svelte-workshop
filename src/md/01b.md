### Introduction to SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications using Svelte. It extends the capabilities of Svelte by adding features necessary for building more complex, full-scale applications, such as server-side rendering, file-based routing, API endpoints, and more. SvelteKit aims to provide a smoother developer experience and enhance productivity with its integrated tooling and optimized project structure.

### Project Structure

A typical SvelteKit project is organized around a few key directories:

- `src/routes`: Contains your pages and their components. Sveltekit uses file-based routing, so each file or directory with an `.svelte` extension in this folder becomes a route based on its file name.
- `src/lib`: Recommended for reusable libraries and components. Components in this directory can be imported into your routes or other components. This directory can be used in imports as `$lib`, which is a special directory that is auto-resolved by Sveltekit at compile-time.
-`.svelte-kit`: Sveltekit dynamically generates types for you at compile-time as well as routing information and other data, and it all goes into this directory.

### Svelte/kit Conventions

Generally in Sveltekit, it's expected that components that are only used within a single page are co-located with that page. 

### Loading Data

In SvelteKit, data loading can be efficiently handled using load functions. These functions run on the server during server-side rendering and on the client during navigation. The returned object(s) from these functions are translated into types in the `$types` folder so that your load functions return objects that are strongly types when accessed on the page.

In order to load data automatically into the `data` prop, we can create the special `+page.ts` and `+page.server.ts`. These functions have access to parameters like page `params` and session `data`, allowing it to fetch data that is specific to the current route.

These functions all run parallel (page, client, and layout loading) and all merge their data into a special exported `data` variable on the page.

In order to load data automatically into the `data` prop, we can create the special `+page.ts` and `+page.server.ts`.

```svelte
<script context="module">
	export async function load({ fetch, params }) {
		const response = await fetch(`/api/data/${params.id}`);
		return { props: { data: await response.json() } };
	}
</script>
```

### Hooks

Hooks in SvelteKit are functions that run in response to lifecycle events on the server, such as handling requests and preparing responses. They are defined in the `src/hooks` directory.

- `handle()`: This hook can manipulate every request and its response. It's useful for custom authentication or logging.
- `getSession()`: Provides context that can be accessed on every server-side page render and in endpoints. It's often used for user sessions.

```svelte
// src/hooks.js
export async function handle({ request, resolve }) {
  const response = await resolve(request);
  // Modify the response here, e.g., set headers
  return response;
}

export function getSession(request) {
  return {
    user: request.locals.user
  };
}
```
