## DOM Events

In Svelte, listening to DOM events is straightforward and integrated directly into the component markup using the `on:eventname` directive. This feature allows you to handle browser events such as clicks, mouse movements, form submissions, and more, directly on the DOM elements defined in your Svelte components. Here’s a detailed look at how you can listen to and handle DOM events in Svelte:

### Basic Event Listening

To listen to an event, you use the `on:` directive followed by the name of the event you want to listen to. This can be directly added to any DOM element in the Svelte template.

#### Example: Listening to a Click Event

```svelte
<script>
	function handleClick() {
		alert('Button clicked!');
	}
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}> Click Me </button>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, Svelte automatically calls the `handleClick` function.

### Passing Event Parameters

Often, you'll need to access the event object to get more information about the event, such as the target element, the key pressed in a keyboard event, or the position of the mouse. Svelte makes this easy by passing the event object to the event handler.

#### Example: Accessing the Event Object

```svelte
<script>
	function handleMouseMove(event) {
		console.log(`Mouse position: ${event.clientX}, ${event.clientY}`);
	}
</script>

<div on:mousemove={handleMouseMove} style="height: 100px; background-color: lightgrey;">
	Move your mouse over me
</div>
```

In this example, `handleMouseMove` receives the mouse event object and logs the cursor's position.

### Event Modifiers

Svelte also provides event modifiers, which are special directives that change the way event handlers are called. These include:

- `preventDefault` — calls `event.preventDefault()` before running the handler.
- `stopPropagation` — calls `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the event from bubbling up.
- `once` — ensures the event handler is called only once.
- `capture` — the event handler is added in the capture phase instead of the bubbling phase.

#### Example: Using Event Modifiers

```svelte
<script>
	function handleSubmit(event) {
		console.log('Form submitted!');
	}
</script>

<form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
	<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Here, the `preventDefault` modifier prevents the form from actually submitting, which allows the page not to reload on submission.

### Inline Event Handlers

For simpler interactions, you might want to define the event handler directly in the markup, especially if the handler is very short.

#### Example: Inline Handler

```svelte
<script>
	let count = 0;
</script>

<button on:click={() => (count += 1)}>
	Count: {count}
</button>
```

This inline function increases the `count` every time the button is clicked, updating the displayed count in the button label.

## Custom Events

Custom events in Svelte components allow you to dispatch events that parent components can listen to, facilitating a clean and decoupled way for components to communicate. This is particularly useful when you want to send data or signal changes to a parent component without directly manipulating parent state.

### Creating Custom Events

To create and dispatch custom events in a Svelte component, you can use the `createEventDispatcher` function provided by Svelte. This function creates a `dispatch` method that can be used to fire custom events that can be listened to by parent components.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';
	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

	function doSomething() {
		// Perform some action
		dispatch('done', { message: 'Action completed!' });
	}
</script>

<button on:click={doSomething}> Click me to do something </button>
```

In this example, the `doSomething` function triggers a custom event named `'done'` with some associated data. The `dispatch` function is used to emit the event.

### Listening to Custom Events in Parent Components

Once a child component has the ability to dispatch custom events, a parent component can listen to these events just as it would listen to standard DOM events like `click`.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import Child from './Child.svelte';

	function handleDone(event) {
		console.log('Received event:', event.detail);
	}
</script>

<Child on:done={handleForDone} />
```

Here, the parent component imports the `Child` component and sets up an event listener for the `done` event. When the `Child` component dispatches the `done` event, the `handleDone` function in the parent is triggered, and it receives the event data via `event.detail`.

### TypeScript Enhancements

If you are using TypeScript, you can enhance this setup by defining a custom type for the event detail, which can help ensure type safety and improve code readability.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';

	interface DoneEventDetail {
		message: string;
	}

	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher<DoneEventDetail>();

	function doSomething() {
		dispatch('done', { message: 'Action completed!' });
	}
</script>

<button on:click={doSomething}> Click me to do something </button>
```

In this TypeScript-enhanced example, the `DoneEventDetail` interface defines the structure of the data that will be sent with the `done` event, providing type safety for the event details.
